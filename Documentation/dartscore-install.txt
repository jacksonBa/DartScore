Pre reqs:

For the Pi:
Hardware:
raspberryPi3, raspberrypi cam,  brackets for mounting, button(s),

Software:
install raspian jessie, instructions are found here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
Enable the camera module and make apropriate settings for wifi-network, hostsname, keyboard  etc

sudo apt-get install python-dev

sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio


install MJPG-streamer, instructions are found here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=48597
or here http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-build-and-run-mjpg-streamer-on-the-raspberry-pi

compile and install opencv for multicore RaspberryPi for best performance.
Check out http://www.pyimagesearch.com for details but I skipped the virtual environment since I only will use the Pi for this project.


Start streamer:

sudo mkdir /tmp/stream
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path /your/path/mjpg_streamer -i "input_file.so -f /tmp/stream -n pic.jpg" -o "output_http.so -w /your/path/www" &




For the PC:
Python development IDE (PyCharm is a good choice)
Firefox to show the video-stream
Putty for connecting remotely to the Pi
WinSCP to syncronize files
GitHub account to get the source-code


Modify ??-file to make streamer-directory and start the streamer automatically at boot
Copy all source-code to the pi and run Main.py in the DartScore directory (sudo python Main.py)
