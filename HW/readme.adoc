= Dartscore hardware

cams, brackets, lightning, moutning details etc etc...

The Cams:
---------
I use a raspberry pi 3 with a raspicam and the motioneye os in fast networked cam setup for
both cams.

The PCB:
--------
In the 'eagle' directory is  a circuit board designed to use with a raspberry pi 4 as the
main cumputing device i the dartscore project.

The pcb is designed with connectors for switches and leds and also for the control of 2 fans,
one for the CPU and one for the 'box'.

In my project I use 'arcade-switches' and they neeed 5V as supply for the built in leds.
Therefore all outputs are 'switched' with mosfets.

The same goes for the fans which are 12V supply (standard PC fans)
