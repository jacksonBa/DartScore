= GameData

This directory contains persisted game data of two categories. All data is saved as python datastructures using the
pickle module.

1: Install settings
-------------------
Saved calibration settings to be reused between games. Without this data the calibration makes a 'cold-start'
wich means that the user has to confirm the settings or change lightning conditions etc

2: Saved Game data
------------------
Saved game data will contain previous players, high-score, saved games etc....
