= Dartscore software...

This readme file describes the DartScore software like DartScoreEngine, FrontEnd, PiSetup...


== Design:
DartScore is coded like a game-loop.
All items in the project (allmost) has at least 3 public methods: initialize, update, draw.
These are called for all objects in the project in a certain sequence.

== The states:
A summary of the states in dartscore. The Load and shutdown states as the IO handling is not yet implemented.

== Root-directory:
*Cam*
A module creating the image-stream. Right now two different types are supported;

STREAM from the real cam via the cam-url and VIDEO from a videofile sent as an argument at initialization.

The VIDEO cam is used for testing purposes.


*Main*:
The start for the project. Only used to start and run the loop and to catch general exceptions.

*MainLoop*:
The mainloop for the project. Implements methods for initialize, update and draw and decides
the order of the other items.

**DartScoreEngine:**
All the calculation, separated in several modules.
VContains DartScoreConfig which is a dictionary with all kinds of settings to separate commonly used parameters from the code.
Not yet used fully but each module will have its own sub config-dictionary.

**Frontend:**
The gui, using pygame to render the gui. Each game-state has its own frontend implementation.

**GameData:**
Store calibration- and game-data etc. Only used for calibration right now.

**PiSetup:**
Manage the IO like buttons, fan, light etc

== Modules/sub-directories:
There are alot of modules and classes to separate things and get a design that is easy to modify.

**if __name__ == "__main__"**
If it is relevant, each module has an ' if __name__ == "__main__" '-statement at the end.
This has two purposes: 1: Unit test of this module, and 2: A description of how to use the module


*BoardCalibration*:
Calibration and setup of board

*Inputs*:
Handles buttons and switches

*Logger*:
To log... Not used yet

*Recorder*:
Record the videostream.

*StateLoops*:
Handles different states in the game. Each game-state has its own loop implementation and a corresponding
frontend (gui).

*Utils*:
Some help methods used in several places

*Vision*:
All things for the vision system, dart-detections etc

*IO*:
Classes for Pi io such as archade-buttons, temp-monitors, fan-control etc

*Testdata*:
Directory for images, files etc used for test...
