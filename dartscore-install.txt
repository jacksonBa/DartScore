Pre reqs:

For the Pi:
Hardware:
raspberryPi, raspberrypi cam, wifi-dongle, brackets for mounting, button(s), 

Software:
install raspian jessie, instructions are found here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
Enable the camera module and make apropriate settings for wifi-network, hostsname, keyboard  etc

sudo apt-get install python-dev

sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio


install MJPG-streamer, instructions are found here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=48597
install opencv: sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv
(There are many ways to do this but this works for me and I don't have to wait 10hrs to compile the source)


Start streamer:

sudo mkdir /tmp/stream
cd mjpg-streamer/mjpg-streamer
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ ./mjpg_streamer -i "input_file.so -f /tmp/stream -n pic.jpg" -o "output_http.so -w ./www" &




For the PC:
Python development IDE (PyCharm is a good choice)
Firefox to show the video-stream
Putty for connecting remotely to the Pi
WinSCP to syncronize files
GitHub account to get the source-code


Modify ??-file to make streamer-directory and start the streamer automatically at boot
Copy all source-code to the pi and run Main.py in the DartScore directory (sudo python Main.py)
